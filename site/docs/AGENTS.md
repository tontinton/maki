# Docs style

Audience: competent devs. Every line earns its place. No hand-holding, no fluff.

## Voice

- Warm, simple, concise; easy for non-native English readers.
- No em-dashes, emojis, contractions, or hedging ("it's worth noting", "generally speaking").
- Plain words over clever idioms: "sends data only to the endpoint you configure", not "never phones home".
- State facts and why they matter; never perform emphasis.
- Vary sentence length; uniform 18-24 word cadence reads machine-made.
- ASCII diagrams in ``` blocks where they beat prose.

## Banned AI mannerisms

- Rule-of-three lists for rhythm instead of content.
- "not X, but Y" / "not just X, it's Y" flips; use "rather than" or state the fact once.
- Balanced antithesis ("everything X, nothing Y").
- Emphatic negation tails ("nowhere else", "nothing more").
- Punchy fragment openers ("Nothing blocks.") and tidy end-of-paragraph summations.
- Parallel negation pairs ("does not X and does not Y").
- Stock vocab: delve, robust, seamless, leverage, landscape, moreover, furthermore.

Fine when genuine: anaphora in scannable checklists ("No prompt text / No model output"), contrasts carrying real information ("`session.id` is on by default, `app.version` is not").

## Structure

- [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/): guides for goals, reference for lookup, concepts for understanding.
- One canonical home per topic; link instead of duplicating.
- Generated pages (tools, providers, configuration, lua-api, plugins, keybindings, commands) come from `maki-docgen`: edit the source, run `just gen-docs`, never edit output by hand.
